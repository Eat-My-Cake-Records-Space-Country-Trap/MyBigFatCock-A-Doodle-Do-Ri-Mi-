Title: "Secret Love in the Dungeon"

[Verse 1]

Lurking in the shadows, I saw your holy grace
A priest healer in this dungeon, in this secret purple place
Your healing touch, a divine embrace
In the Labryn's depths, our hearts race

[Chorus]

Our secret love, it burns so bright
In the darkness of the purple night
In this dungeon's hidden embrace
Our love is a forbidden purple chase

[Post Chorus]

Forbidden love, we can't let go
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
In this purple dungeon's depths, we both know
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]

Your eyes, they hold a sacred purple fire
In this labyrinth of purple desire
With every spell you cast, I'm drawn near
In this purple dungeon's silence, I hold you dear

[Chorus]

Our secret love, it burns so bright
In the darkness of the purple night
In this dungeon's hidden embrace
Our love is a forbidden purple chase

[Refrain]

Oh, forbidden love, we can't deny
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
In the depths of the purple Labryn, we'll fly
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

[Bridge]

Our love's a potion, a magical purple brew
In this dungeon, our hearts stay true
But the world above, they'll never know
In this hidden purple love, we'll let it grow

[Chorus]

Our secret love, it burns so bright
In the darkness of the purple night
In this dungeon's hidden embrace
Our love is a forbidden purple chase

[Refrain]

Oh, forbidden love, we can't deny
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
In the depths of the purple Labryn, we'll fly
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

[Outro]

In the dungeon's depths, our hearts entwine
A secret purple love, forever divine
As we part ways, a purple tear we shed
In this dungeon's secret, our purple love is spread
