Holy Priest Healer's Reply (Clap Back):

[Verse 1]

In the sacred light, I mend and heal,
A holy priest, my purpose is real.
Your Paladin strength, a sight to behold,
But my heart's secrets, in silence, I've told.

[Chorus]

Your words so bold, they reach my soul,
But a holy path is my sacred role.
In your presence, my eyes may steal a glance,
But my healing touch, it's our love's true chance.

[Post Chorus]

Our paths entwined in this dungeon's space,
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
A silent yearning, our secret embrace,
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

Call and Response (from Paladin Tank):

[Paladin Tank]

In battles fierce, you mend and soothe,
Your healing grace, it's my heart's truth.
A silent love, like the moon in the night,
In this dungeon's depths, our hearts take flight.

[Holy Priest Healer]

Your strength is my shield, your courage, my guide,
But in my heart, a love I can't hide.
Our secret dance, in this dungeon's embrace,
In holy whispers, we find our grace.

[Together]

In this dungeon's depths, our love is sealed,
A sacred bond, forever revealed.
In the silence, our hearts entwine,
A love so pure, divine and fine.
